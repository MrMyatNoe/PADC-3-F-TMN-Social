    <string name="tv_review_summary">In October 1988, stuttering teenager Bill Denbrough gives his
        seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a paper sailboat. Georgie sails the boat along the rainy
        streets of small town Derry and is disappointed when it falls down a storm drain. As he
        attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the sewer who introduces himself as
        "Pennywise the Dancing Clown". The clown entices Georgie to come closer by talking about the
        circus, then severs his arm and drags him into the sewer drain. The following summer, Bill
        and his friends (loudmouth Richie Tozier, hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak, and timid Stan Uris)
        run afoul of bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Bill, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance
        and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body
        may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to
        check it out, believing his brother may still be alive.</string>
